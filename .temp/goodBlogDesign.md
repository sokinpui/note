# Good Blog Design
* should not provide unnessary link, distripe reading.
* should be clean enough, but no difficult when reading.
* should provide less interactive button or link hide the unnesscary tag and 
    link group the contents in group or in data structure.
- no need for comments. comment can be discuss outside the blog, like the 
relationship between yabai and skhd.
