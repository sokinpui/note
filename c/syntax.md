# Use of bracket
Other good code pratice is to use bracket everywhere, while it looks like more 
clean and easy to follow.

# Accept no bracket
`if-else` is treat as one single block whatever nested level of `else if`.
`while {}`, `for {}` are single block again, so sometimes nested loops don't 
require bracket for the top level.
