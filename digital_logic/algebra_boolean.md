Duality: interchange two operation and 0/1 got the same result    

minterm and maxterm are obtained by every combination of AND and OR respectively.

canonical form is the function expressed in form of sum of minterms or product of maxterms

sum of minterm cares only the terms give 1 
product of macterm cares only the terms give 0

***Sum of minterms*** is in the Sum of Products (SOP) form. So, there is OR operation between the minterms. Note here that OR has “minimum” satisfiability. Even if one minterm is true, the SOP will be true(1) irrespective of the value of other minterms.

***Product of maxterms*** is in the Product of Sums (POS) form. So, there is AND operation between the maxterms. Here, AND has “maximum” satisfiability because the output will be true if and only if all the maxterms gives true(1).

In **Sum of Products** (what you call ANDs) only one of the minterms must be true for the expression to be true. In **Product of Sums** (what you call ORs) all the maxterms must be true for the expression to be true.

invertor of minterms equal to maxterms
