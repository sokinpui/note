# Sharon Simpling Theorem
If the signal have frequency boundary $f$, then any simple rate higher than $2f$ 
is enough for simpling without actual dateloss.

# simpling resolution
simpling resolution represent numbers of bit that can use to represent a dicrect 
simpling. Higher resolution(greater number of bits) can have more gradations of 
amplitude(more level).
