rotation is positive if it is in anti-clockwise.
the rotation matrix along y-axis is negative in right-hand syste

translation: $v=u+t$  
sweep line: $sr_1 + (1-s)r_0$ where $0 ≤ s ≤ 1$

homogeneous coordinates: use virtual coordinates in higher dimension to avoid addition in translation.

homogeneouts form of coordinates: [insert picture herer.]
