we make the condition in form $g(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) = 0$ for convenient.
we look for the largest value of the function f under condition g, when f
arrive the maxima or the minima, the tangent plane of f at that p shoudl be
parallel to the tangent plane of g at the same point, so the normal plane 
$\nable f$ and $\nabla g$ should be the parallel.
by letting:
$$ L(x, y, \lambda) = f(x, y) - \lambda g(x, y) $$
by finding the maxim/minima of L, we are going to get the maxim/minima of f
the maxima/minima can be found by obtaining $L_{x, y ,\lambda} = 0$
then solve by system of equation to find the desired maxima/minima point $P$

# Notes. 
1. Note that our final goal is the point $P$, but not the multiplers.
2. the variable can append more, and the condition can also append more.


$$L(t) = c(t_0) + (t-t_0)c'(t_0)$$
$$ ti + t^2j + t^3k $$

other than lagrange mulitplies, 
any way can use for find the maxim/mimima, even withou derivative.
when $f_{xx} > 0$ and $f_{yy}<0$ , then the point is the saddle point.
