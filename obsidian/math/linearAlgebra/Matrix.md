If $A$ is an $m\times p$ matrix and $B$ is a $p \times n$ matrix, we can then conclude that the $j$th colum of the product $AB$ can be as a linear combination of the colums of matrix $A$ where the coefficients are the entries in the $j$th column of matrix $B$

**Coefficient Matrix** 
$$Ax=b$$
where $A$ is the coefficient matrix and $b$ is the column vector of constant terms 

**Special matrix**
A matrix is called symmetric if $A^T=A$ 
A matrix is called skew symmetric if $A^T=-A$ 

**Matrix transformation**
$$f:R^n\rightarrow R^m = Ax$$
where $A$ is a $m\times n$ matrix, and $x$ is an n-dimensional vector $A$ is called transformation matrix 

Subtracting the mean from each observation is called centering the data

**Elementary Matrix**
$E_k$ is a Elementary matrix which represent a row operation 
way tot find inverese matrix 

**Equivalent Matrix**
B can be obtain by perform row and column operation on A.

**LU-factorization**
$$A = LU$$
$L$ is  the elementary matrix
Transforming $U\rightarrow A$, so only inversible matrix have LU-factorization
