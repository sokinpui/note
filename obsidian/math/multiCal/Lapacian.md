Gradient of divergence of vector field

divergence of gradient of scalar field, 

Why the normal seems to point downwards?

It is a three variables function which is $w = f(x, y ,z)$, solid like.
so the gradient is the direction it tends to move, when it attends maximum, it will tends to lower position of the layer. which the diverence is negative and the normal of some cross section seem like points to downwards.
similarly, minimum follows.
