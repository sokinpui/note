***Single integral***= integral over a line

***Double integral*** = integral over a plane, it is sometimes more convenient for calculation to transfer into polar system

***Triple integral*** = integral over a solid, which is not equal to obtain the volume if triple integral with a three variables function.

### Triple integral in different coordinates systems
spherical coordinates:
$$\iiint_Rf(x,y,z)dV=\int_{\beta_1}^{\beta_2}\int_{\alpha_1}^{\alpha_2} \int_{r_1}^{r_2} f(R, \phi, \theta)R^2sin\phi dRd\phi d\theta$$
cylinderical coordinates: 
$$\iiint_Rf(x,y,z)dV=\int_{\alpha|1}^{\alpha_2}\int_{r_1}^{r_2}\int_{z_1}^{z_2} f(z,r,\theta)rdzdrd\theta$$



If the region is bounded by coordinates planes, It is clearly that

### Area of Curved surface :
$$S=\iint_R \sqrt{f_x^2+f_y^2+1} dA $$

or
$$S = \iint_R\frac{dA}{cos\gamma}  $$
It is done by projection of the area on the x-y plane onto to the curved surface above it.
