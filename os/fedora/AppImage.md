# What is AppImage?
AppImage is a relatively new packaging format that gives you a click-to-run way 
of running applications in Linux. Unlike traditional DEB/RPM packages, AppImages 
can be used on any distribution and this is what makes them so attractive to the 
Linux users.

AppImage doesnâ€™t really install the software. It is a compressed image with all 
the dependencies and libraries needed to run the desired software.

Similiar to Microsoft `.exe` file, if the appimamge is deleted, then the 
software is deleted.
