using `javac` to compile .java file.
compile then run a .java file
```sh
javac source.java
java source.java
```

or complie then auto run a single source .java file using
```sh
java source.java
```

the reason we need javac is to create .class files so that code can be created, 
tested, distributed, run, shared, etc. like it is today.
