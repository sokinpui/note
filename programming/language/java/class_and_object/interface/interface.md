# What is interface?
Interface is like abstruct method, but including method instead.

# default and static method in interface
The method define with static and default contain the expression of the method 
by defualt.

# Define interface as type
If you define a reference variable whose type is an interface, any object you 
assign to it must be an instance of a class that implements the interface.
