# relationship between type parameters and object
If the type parameters is not the same, even the parameters have relationship, 
the object have no relation. For example: Box<Number> and Box<Integer> have no 
relation. However, if they have the same type parameters, they may have 
relation, if the objects have relation, for example, List<Number> and 
ArrayList<Integer> have relation, since ArrayList is the subset of List.
