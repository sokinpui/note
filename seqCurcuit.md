Debouncing, a RS latch can be use d to debounce the switch to avoid the noise when the 
voltage switch from active high to active low.

RS(S'R') and SR Flip flops is the clocked version of the latch.
Use D flip flops for parallel data transfer.

Jk flip flops can choose the value according to the input of $j$ and $k$ states, it can 
produce state from $Q$, $Q'$, $1$ and $0$.

T flip flop from d flip flop.
When J and K connect to the same input, it become T flip flops.

Reset and clear, asynchronous input.
Asynchronous input(reset and clear) can change the state of the flip flops outside the 
input of the flip flops inputs, as it applys change on the present states.
